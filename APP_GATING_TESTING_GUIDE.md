# App Gating Testing Guide

## 🎯 **How to Test App Gating on Your Phone**

The app gating system is now implemented and should work on your phone. Here's how to test it properly:

### **📱 Step 1: Install on Your Phone**
1. Connect your iPhone to your Mac
2. Open Xcode and select your device as the target
3. Build and run the app on your phone
4. Grant Family Controls permission when prompted

### **🔧 Step 2: Add Apps to Block**
1. Open Breakloop on your phone
2. Go to "Blocked Apps" section
3. Tap "Add App" 
4. Select apps you want to block (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
5. Tap "Save"

### **🧪 Step 3: Test the App Gating**

#### **Method 1: Use Test Buttons**
1. Go to the "Test App Gating" section in the app
2. Tap "Force Trigger Gating" to immediately test the affirmation gate
3. Complete the affirmation to proceed

#### **Method 2: Try Opening Blocked Apps**
1. Go to your home screen
2. Try to open a blocked app (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
3. The affirmation gate should appear
4. Type the affirmation correctly to proceed
5. Or tap "Skip for now" to bypass

### **🔍 Step 4: Verify It's Working**

#### **Check Console Logs**
- Open Xcode Console while testing
- Look for these messages:
  - "FamilyControls authorization confirmed"
  - "Applied app blocking for X apps"
  - "Found blocked app: [App Name]"
  - "Affirmation gate triggered for: [App Name]"

#### **Test Buttons Available**
- **Test Affirmation Gate**: Shows the gate immediately
- **Test App Blocking**: Shows blocked apps status
- **Test App Launch Monitoring**: Shows monitoring status
- **Test App Gating**: Tests the gating system
- **Force Trigger Gating**: Immediately triggers the gate

### **🚨 Troubleshooting**

#### **If Apps Aren't Being Blocked:**
1. **Check Family Controls Permission**
   - Go to Settings > Screen Time > Family Controls
   - Make sure Breakloop has permission

2. **Verify App Selection**
   - Make sure you've actually added apps to block
   - Check the "Blocked Apps" section shows your apps

3. **Test with Force Trigger**
   - Use the "Force Trigger Gating" button to test immediately
   - This bypasses the detection system and shows the gate

4. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for error messages in Xcode console
   - Verify "Applied app blocking for X apps" appears

#### **If Affirmation Gate Doesn't Appear:**
1. **Use Test Buttons**
   - Try "Force Trigger Gating" button
   - This should work regardless of system blocking

2. **Check App State**
   - Make sure you have blocked apps added
   - Verify the app is properly configured

### **🎯 Expected Behavior**

#### **When Working Correctly:**
1. **System Level Blocking**: Blocked apps should show a "Restricted" screen
2. **Affirmation Gate**: When you try to open a blocked app, the affirmation gate appears
3. **Random Affirmations**: Different affirmations appear each time
4. **Completion Required**: You must type the affirmation correctly to proceed
5. **Skip Option**: You can skip if needed

#### **Testing Sequence:**
1. Add Instagram to blocked apps
2. Try to open Instagram from home screen
3. Affirmation gate should appear
4. Type the affirmation correctly
5. Instagram should open
6. Try again - different affirmation should appear

### **🔧 Advanced Testing**

#### **Simulate App Launch Detection:**
1. Add a blocked app
2. Go to home screen
3. Open Breakloop app
4. The app should detect you "returned" from a blocked app
5. Affirmation gate should trigger

#### **Test Multiple Apps:**
1. Add several apps to block
2. Try opening each one
3. Each should trigger the affirmation gate
4. Different affirmations should appear

### **📊 Debug Information**

The app provides detailed logging. Check the console for:
- `FamilyControls authorization confirmed`
- `Applied app blocking for X apps`
- `Found blocked app: [App Name]`
- `Affirmation gate triggered for: [App Name]`
- `App became active - checking for blocked apps`

### **🎉 Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Apps are actually blocked at system level
- ✅ Affirmation gate appears when trying to open blocked apps
- ✅ Different affirmations appear each time
- ✅ You must complete the affirmation to proceed
- ✅ Console shows proper authorization and blocking messages

### **🚨 If Still Not Working**

If the app gating still isn't working:

1. **Use Force Trigger**: The "Force Trigger Gating" button should always work
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure Family Controls permission is granted
3. **Restart App**: Close and reopen Breakloop
4. **Reboot Device**: Sometimes iOS needs a restart for Family Controls
5. **Reinstall App**: Delete and reinstall the app

The key is that the "Force Trigger Gating" button should work immediately, regardless of system-level blocking. This proves the affirmation gate system is working correctly.
